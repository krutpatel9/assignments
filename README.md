# Turn-in Instructions

These are the bare minimum instructions you should follow for every assignment.  Additional instructions or direction may be provided in the assignment file, but always ensure that you follow these steps.

* Create an issue in _this_ repository for every assignment
    * Name it according to the assignment name with your name appended, e.g.  `1.1 - Personal Website - Jacob Smith`
    * If tasks (i.e. check boxes) are provided for you in the assignment file, include them as the _description_ of your WIP Issue
    * If tasks are _not_ provided for you (as in later assignments), create your own; you will be expected to break down many assignments on your own
* _Check off tasks as you finish to demonstrate progress_; note the progress bar in [the Issues list](https://github.com/TIY-GVL-FEE-2015-August/assignments/issues) for each issue
* Create a new repository for the assignment
    * Name the repository according to the assignment, but dasherized, e.g. `1.1-personal-website`
    * Push to Github regularly to show progress
* [Add a link to your Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github/#references) in a comment on your Issue

* To "turn in" the assignment, close the issue, adding the following as a comment:
  - What your "Learning Zone" score for the assignment was. (See notes for explanation)
  - How long did you spend on the assignment. (Judgement Free Zone)
  - What the results were. For example:
    - I finished and like the result
    - I finished but wish I knew a better way
    - I finished... but I'm not sure how I did it
    - I didn't finish, but I can #shipit with some completed features
    - I didn't finish... and nothing runs right now
    - etc.
